Zeek has two primary layers; "Event Engine" and "Policy Script Interpreter". The Event Engine layer is where the packets are processed; it is called the event core and is responsible for describing the event without focusing on event details. It is where the packages are divided into parts such as source and destination addresses, protocol identification, session analysis and file extraction. The Policy Script Interpreter layer is where the semantic analysis is conducted. It is responsible for describing the event correlations by using Zeek scripts.

Zeek Frameworks
Zeek has several frameworks to provide extended functionality in the scripting layer. These frameworks enhance Zeek's flexibility and compatibility with other network components. Each framework focuses on the specific use case and easily runs with Zeek installation. For instance, we will be using the "Logging Framework" for all cases. Having ide on each framework's functionality can help users quickly identify an event of interest.
