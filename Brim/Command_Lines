going to look at the conn path, then pipe that into the IP address for CobaltStrike. 
From the IP address, we then pipe the results into the cut function. 
The cut function then removes the id.orig_h, id.resp_p, id.resp_h to display in the main field, 
the results from cut are then piped into sort. Then Sort will then sort the results 
so far numerically, then those results are piped through uniq -c. 
Uniq will then remove any time an instance appears more than once., 
leaving one instance only, the -c will then show how many times the instance appears.
 Pressing enter will then run the filtering command.
