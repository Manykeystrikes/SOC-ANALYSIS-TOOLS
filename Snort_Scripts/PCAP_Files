#
#Capabilities of Snort are not limited to sniffing, logging and detecting/preventing the threats. PCAP read/investigate mode helps you work with pcap files. Once you have a pcap file and process it with Snort, you will receive default traffic statistics with alerts depending on your ruleset.

Reading a pcap without using any additional parameters we discussed before will only overview the packets and provide statistics about the file. In most cases, this is not very handy. We are investigating the pcap with Snort to benefit from the rules and speed up our investigation process by using the known patterns of threats. 

Note that we are pretty close to starting to create rules. Therefore, you need to grasp the working mechanism of the Snort, learn the discussed parameters and begin combining the parameters for different purposes.

PCAP mode parameters are explained in the table below;

Parameter	Description
-r / --pcap-single=	Read a single pcap
--pcap-list=""	Read pcaps provided in command (space separated).
--pcap-show	Show pcap name on console during processing.

IDS (INTERUSION PREVENTION SYSTEM)
IPS (INTRUSION PREVENTION SYSTEM)

Action
There are several actions for rules. Make sure you understand the functionality and test it before creating rules for live systems. The most common actions are listed below.

alert: Generate an alert and log the packet.
log: Log the packet.
drop: Block and log the packet.
reject: Block the packet, log it and terminate the packet session. 
Protocol
Protocol parameter identifies the type of the protocol that filtered for the rule.

Note that Snort2 supports only four protocols filters in the rules (IP, TCP, UDP and ICMP). However, you can detect the application flows using port numbers and options. For instance, if you want to detect FTP traffic, you cannot use the FTP keyword in the protocol field but filter the FTP traffic by investigating TCP traffic on port 21.

IP and Port Numbers

These parameters identify the source and destination IP addresses and associated port numbers filtered for the rule.

IP Filtering	
alert icmp 192.168.1.56 any <> any any  (msg: "ICMP Packet From "; sid: 100001; rev:1;)
This rule will create an alert for each ICMP packet originating from the 192.168.1.56 IP address.
Filter an IP range
alert icmp 192.168.1.0/24 any <> any any  (msg: "ICMP Packet Found"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)
This rule will create an alert for each ICMP packet originating from the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet.
Filter multiple IP ranges
alert icmp [192.168.1.0/24, 10.1.1.0/24] any <> any any  (msg: "ICMP Packet Found"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)
This rule will create an alert for each ICMP packet originating from the 192.168.1.0/24 and 10.1.1.0/24 subnets.
Exclude IP addresses/ranges
"negation operator" is used for excluding specific addresses and ports. Negation operator is indicated with "!"
alert icmp !192.168.1.0/24 any <> any any  (msg: "ICMP Packet Found"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)
This rule will create an alert for each ICMP packet not originating from the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet.
Port Filtering	
alert tcp any any <> any 21  (msg: "FTP Port 21 Command Activity Detected"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)
This rule will create an alert for each TCP packet sent to port 21.
Exclude a specific port
alert tcp any any <> any !21  (msg: "Traffic Activity Without FTP Port 21 Command Channel"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)
This rule will create an alert for each TCP packet not sent to port 21.
Filter a port range (Type 1)
alert tcp any any <> any 1:1024   (msg: "TCP 1-1024 System Port Activity"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)
This rule will create an alert for each TCP packet sent to ports between 1-1024.
Filter a port range (Type 2)
alert tcp any any <> any :1024   (msg: "TCP 0-1024 System Port Activity"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)
This rule will create an alert for each TCP packet sent to ports less than or equal to 1024.
Filter a port range (Type 3)
alert tcp any any <> any 1025: (msg: "TCP Non-System Port Activity"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)
This rule will create an alert for each TCP packet sent to source port higher than or equal to 1025.
Filter a port range (Type 4)
alert tcp any any <> any [21,23] (msg: "FTP and Telnet Port 21-23 Activity Detected"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)
This rule will create an alert for each TCP packet sent to port 21 and 23.

General Rule Options

Msg	The message field is a basic prompt and quick identifier of the rule. Once the rule is triggered, the message filed will appear in the console or log. Usually, the message part is a one-liner that summarises the event.
Sid
Snort rule IDs (SID) come with a pre-defined scope, and each rule must have a SID in a proper format. There are three different scopes for SIDs shown below.

<100: Reserved rules
100-999,999: Rules came with the build.
>=1,000,000: Rules created by user.
Briefly, the rules we will create should have sid greater than 100.000.000. Another important point is; SIDs should not overlap, and each id must be unique. 

Reference
Each rule can have additional information or reference to explain the purpose of the rule or threat pattern. That could be a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) id or external information. Having references for the rules will always help analysts during the alert and incident investigation.
Rev
Snort rules can be modified and updated for performance and efficiency issues. Rev option help analysts to have the revision information of each rule. Therefore, it will be easy to understand rule improvements. Each rule has its unique rev number, and there is no auto-backup feature on the rule history. Analysts should keep the rule history themselves. Rev option is only an indicator of how many times the rule had revisions.

alert icmp any any <> any any (msg: "ICMP Packet Found"; sid: 100001; reference:cve,CVE-XXXX; rev:1;)

#Once rule is created the rule should be stored ion the 'local.rules file
sudo gedit /etc/snort/rules/local.rules

alert icmp any any -> any any (msg: "ICMP Packet Found"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)

#Example
alert icmp any any <> any any (msg: "ICMP Packet Found"; sid: 100001; reference:cve,CVE-XXXX; rev:1;)

alert ip any any <> any any (msg: "IP ID";id:35369; sid:1000001; rev:1;)

alert TCP any any <> any any (msg: "FLAG TEST";flags:S; sid:1000001; rev:1;)

filter packets with 2 flgas eg flags:PA
alert TCP any any <> any any (msg: "FLAG TEST";flags:PA; sid:1000001; rev:1;)

#To edit local rules
sudo gedit local.rules

#To run the required rule
snort -c local.rules -A full -l . -r task9.pcap

alert tcp any any <> any any (msg: "SAME IP"; sameip; sid:35369; rev:1;)
alert udp any any <> any any (msg: "SAME IP"; sameip; sid:35369; rev:1;)
