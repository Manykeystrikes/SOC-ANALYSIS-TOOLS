#Hunting for Open Ports with PowerShell

#To hunt for open ports with PowerShell we will be using the PowerShell module Get-WinEvent along with XPath queries. We can use the same  XPath queries that we used in the rule to 
filter out events from NetworkConnect with DestinationPort. The command line is typically used over the Event Viewer GUI because it 
can allow for further granular control and filtering that the GUI does not offer. For more information about using XPath 
and the command line for event viewing, check out the Windows Event Log room by Heavenraiza.
