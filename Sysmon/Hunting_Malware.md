Hunting Malware Overview

Malware has many forms and variations with different end goals. The two types of malware that we will be focusing on are RATs and backdoors. RATs or Remote Access Trojans are used similar to any other payload to gain remote access to a machine. RATs typically come with other Anti-Virus and detection evasion techniques that make them different than other payloads like MSFVenom. A RAT typically also uses a Client-Server model and comes with an interface for easy user administration. Examples of RATs are Xeexe and Quasar. To help detect and hunt malware we will need to first identify the malware that we want to hunt or detect and identify ways that we can modify configuration files, this is known as hypothesis-based hunting. There are of course a plethora of other ways to detect and log malware however we will only be covering the basic way of detecting open back connect ports. 

For more information about this technique and examples of malware check out MITRE ATT&CK Software. 

You can download the event logs used in this room from this task or you can open them in the Practice folder on the provided machine.

Hunting Rats and C2 Servers

The first technique we will use to hunt for malware is a similar process to hunting Metasploit. We can look through and create a configuration file to hunt and detect suspicious ports open on the endpoint. By using known suspicious ports to include in our logs we can add to our hunting methodology in which we can use logs to identify adversaries on our network then use packet captures or other detection strategies to continue the investigation. The code snippet below is from the Ion-Storm configuration file which will alert when specific ports like 1034 and 1604 as well as exclude common network connections like OneDrive, by excluding events we still see everything that we want without missing anything and cutting down on noise. 

When using configuration files in a production environment you must be careful and understand exactly what is happening within the configuration file an example of this is the Ion-Storm configuration file excludes port 53 as an event. Attackers and adversaries have begun to use port 53 as part of their malware/payloads which would go undetected if you blindly used this configuration file as-is.

For more information about the ports that this configuration file alerts on check out this spreadsheet.

<RuleGroup name="" groupRelation="or">
	<NetworkConnect onmatch="include">
		<DestinationPort condition="is">1034</DestinationPort>
		<DestinationPort condition="is">1604</DestinationPort>
	</NetworkConnect>
	<NetworkConnect onmatch="exclude">
		<Image condition="image">OneDrive.exe</Image>
	</NetworkConnect>
</RuleGroup>


Open C:\Users\THM-Analyst\Desktop\Scenarios\Practice\Hunting_Rats.evtx in Event Viewer to view a live rat being dropped onto the server.

In the above example, we are detecting a custom RAT that operates on port 8080. This is a perfect example of why you want to be careful when excluding events in order to not miss potential malicious activity.

Hunting for Common Back Connect Ports with PowerShell

Just like previous sections when using PowerShell we will again be using the PowerShell module Get-WinEvent along with XPath queries to filter our events and gain granular control over our logs. We will need to filter on the NetworkConnect event ID and the DestinationPort data attribute. If you're using a good configuration file with a reliable set of rules it will do a majority of the heavy lifting and filtering to what you want should be easy.

Get-WinEvent -Path <Path to Log> -FilterXPath '*/System/EventID=3 and */EventData/Data[@Name="DestinationPort"] and */EventData/Data=<Port>'
